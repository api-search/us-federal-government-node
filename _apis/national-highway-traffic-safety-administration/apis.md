  The NHTSA Product Information Catalog Vehicle Listing (vPIC) Application
  Programming Interface (API) provides different ways to gather information on
  Vehicles and their specifications. The vPIC Dataset is populated using the

  submittals. All the information on how a VIN is assigned by the manufacturer
  is captured in this catalog and used to decode a VIN and extract vehicle
  information. ~ https://vpic.nhtsa.dot.gov/api/
